== Description ==

The *Add Chat App Button* plugin enables adding a customizable click-to-chat WhatsApp button.
The plugin lets you choose between a simple WhatsApp icon and a rectangle with a custom text label (see screenshots).

== Usage == 

The plugin settings page has two tabs: "General Settings" and "Button Design".

*The General Settings tab* includes options such as limiting the button to only display under a certain screen resolution (in pixels), attaching a default message that will be populated in the user's phone when they click the button, and more.

*The Button Design tab* includes controls for the button color, label text color, button type (side-bearing rectangle, WhatsApp icon, fixed-bottom button), and more. The Button Design tab also includes a smartphone mockup with a **live** preview screen, enabling you to see a real-time (estimated) rendering of how your button would look, on the fly, as you are changing its design.

The plugin detects whether the site visitor is using a desktop or mobile device and serves a different link for each accordingly.
